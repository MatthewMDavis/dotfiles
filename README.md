# Config Files Repo
This is an assemblage of files pulling together a bunch of vim, tmux, and zsh
configurations borrowed from elsewhere, particularly [Chris
Toomey](http://github.com/christoomey), whose vim configuration I have found
to be stellar.

I'm big into the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme, and an rbenv user, and all
configurations seek to leverage those preferences wherever possible. [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) is the glue that holds the whole thing together, and is intended to be turned on basically all the time.

Ruby testing can be run straight from vim, and keyboard navigation is
seamless between Tmux and vim. I'm not nearly clever enough to have cooked
this up on my own, but I'm smart enough to use it.
